# 2020

In progress.
Written in [zig](https://ziglang.org).

## Run a solution

To build or run a specific day, change the ```src``` variable in ```build.zig```.
You can use:
```
zig build
```
or
```
zig build run
```
to build or build&run the executable.

## Disclaimer

This repo is meant for me as an experiment using zig.
I am not a zig expert and you should not assume any of the code is *optimal* :)
