In progress.
Written in [zig](https://ziglang.org).

## Run a solution

build.zig provides a run and build target for every day.
To compile and run you can use:
```zig
zig build runXX
```
where XX is the day number.

For example, for day 1 try:
```zig
zig build run01
```

## Disclaimer

This repo is meant for me as an experiment using zig.
I am not a zig expert and you should not assume any of the code is *optimal* :)
